Magnitude
To calculate the distance of Vector 2 or Vector 3 to use V.Distance is not the best choise, because it cost more performance.
This is because use sqrt will make a complex calculation. so we use square instead of using sqr root.

Before:
float distance = Vector3.Distance(target, start);
if (distance < range) 
{
    // In the distance
}

After:
if ((target - start).sqrMagnitude < range * range)
{
    // In the distance
}
